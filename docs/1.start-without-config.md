## start without webpack.config.js

## install webpack webpack-cli

> why need install two npm package? because it need in the source code

```js
mkdir webpack-demo
cd webpack-demo
npm init -y
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

after install
run `npx webpack`
will make a dist file the mode is production by default

change mode `npx webpack --mode development`

final output js is

```js
// var obj = { id : func}
// id is file path func is arrow func that return the code by invoke eval
(() => {
  // webpackBootstrap
  var __webpack_modules__ = {
    "./src/index.js": () => {
      eval(
        "console.log(111);\n\n\n//# sourceURL=webpack://webpack5-demo/./src/index.js?"
      );
    },
  };
  var __webpack_exports__ = {};
  __webpack_modules__["./src/index.js"]();
})();
```
