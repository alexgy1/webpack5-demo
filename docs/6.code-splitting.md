## There are three general approaches to code splitting available:

1. Entry Points: Manually split code using entry configuration.
2. Prevent Duplication: Use Entry dependencies or SplitChunksPlugin to dedupe and split chunks.
3. Dynamic Imports: Split code via inline function calls within modules.

## 1

If there are any duplicated modules between entry chunks they will be included in both bundles.
It isn't as flexible and can't be used to dynamically split code with the core application logic.

Prevent Duplication
Entry dependencies
The dependOn option allows to share the modules between the chunks:

If we're going to use multiple entry points on a single HTML page, optimization.runtimeChunk: 'single' is needed too, otherwise we could get into trouble described here.

As you can see there's another runtime.bundle.js file generated besides shared.bundle.js, index.bundle.js and another.bundle.js.

## SplitChunksPlugin

```js
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: {
    //entry config like this
    index: "./src/index.js",
    another: "./src/another-module.js",
  },
  output: {
    filename: "[name].bundle.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
  },
  //add this line
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: "all",
    },
  },
};
```

Here are some other useful plugins and loaders provided by the community for splitting code:

## 3 Dynamic Imports

> Two similar techniques are supported by webpack when it comes to dynamic code splitting. The first and recommended approach is to use the import() syntax that conforms to the ECMAScript proposal for dynamic imports. The legacy, webpack-specific approach is to use require.ensure. Let's try using the first of these two approaches...

- import() es6
- require.ensure webpack-specific approach

remove entry senond config and file

```js
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: {
    index: "./src/index.js",
    //remove
    another: "./src/another-module.js",
  },
  output: {
    filename: "[name].bundle.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
  },
  //remove
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: "all",
    },
  },
};
```
