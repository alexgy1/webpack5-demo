## Using a Configuration

As of version 4, webpack doesn't require any configuration, but most projects will need a more complex setup, which is why webpack supports a configuration file. **This is much more efficient than having to manually type in a lot of commands in the terminal**, so let's create one:

```js
  webpack-demo
  |- package.json
 |- webpack.config.js add this file
  |- /dist
    |- index.html
  |- /src
    |- index.js


//add this  in webpack.config.js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```

run `npx webpack --config webpack.config.js` to generate `dist` file with `main.js`

NPM Scripts

Given it's not particularly fun to run a local copy of webpack from the CLI, we can set up a little shortcut. Let's adjust our package.json by adding an npm script:

```js
   "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack"
   },
```

run `npm run build`

## Conclusion

Now that you have a basic build together you should move on to the next guide Asset Management to learn how to manage assets like images and fonts with webpack. At this point, your project should look like this:

```js
webpack-demo
|- package.json
|- webpack.config.js
|- /dist
  |- main.js
  |- index.html
|- /src
  |- index.js
|- /node_modules
Tip
If you're using npm 5+, you'll probably also see a package-lock.json file in your directory.
