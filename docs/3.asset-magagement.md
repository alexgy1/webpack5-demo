## [ref](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/)

Now let's try to incorporate some other assets, like images, to see how they can be handled

Prior to webpack, front-end developers would use tools like grunt and gulp to process these assets and move them from their /src folder into their /dist or /build directory. The same idea was used for JavaScript modules, but tools like webpack will dynamically bundle all dependencies (creating what's known as a dependency graph). This is great because every module now explicitly states its dependencies and we'll avoid bundling modules that aren't in use.

One of the coolest webpack features is that you can also include any other type of file, besides JavaScript, for which there is a loader or built-in Asset Modules support. This means that the same benefits listed above for JavaScript (e.g. explicit dependencies) can be applied to everything used in building a website or web app. Let's start with CSS, as you may already be familiar with that setup.

change dist/index.html and webpack.config.js

## loading css

`npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader`

Module loaders can be chained. Each loader in the chain applies transformations to the processed resource. A chain is executed in reverse order. The first loader passes its result (resource with applied transformations) to the next one, and so forth. Finally, webpack expects JavaScript to be returned by the last loader in the chain.

The above order of loaders should be maintained: 'style-loader' comes first and followed by 'css-loader'. If this convention is not followed, webpack is likely to throw errors.

webpack uses a regular expression to determine which files it should look for and serve to a specific loader. In this case, any file that ends with .css will be served to the style-loader and the css-loader.

This enables you to import './style.css' into the file that depends on that styling. Now, when that module is run, a <style> tag with the stringified css will be inserted into the <head> of your html file.

add a `style.css` in /src

run `npm run build`

Open up dist/index.html in your browser again and you should see that Hello webpack is now styled in red

o see what webpack did, inspect the page (don't view the page source, as it won't show you the result, because the <style> tag is dynamically created by JavaScript) and look at the page's head tags. It should contain the style block that we imported in index.js.

Note that you can, and in most cases should, minimize css for better load times in production. On top of that, loaders exist for pretty much any flavor of CSS you can think of â€“ postcss, sass, and less to name a few.

## Loading Images

So now we're pulling in our CSS, but what about our images like backgrounds and icons? As of webpack 5, using the **built-in Asset Modules** we can easily incorporate those in our system as well:

Now, when you import MyImage from './my-image.png', that image will be processed and added to your output directory and the MyImage variable will contain the final url of that image after processing. When using the css-loader, as shown above, a similar process will occur for url('./my-image.png') within your CSS. The loader will recognize this is a local file, and replace the './my-image.png' path with the final path to the image in your output directory. The html-loader handles <img src="./my-image.png" /> in the same manner.

change style.css add backgroud-img and add icon in /src

run `npm run build`

If all went well, you should now see your icon as a repeating background, as well as an img element beside our Hello webpack text. If you inspect this element, you'll see that the actual filename has changed to something like 29822eaa871e8eadeaa4.png. This means webpack found our file in the src folder and processed it!

## Loading Fonts https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/#loading-fonts

```js
{
        test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf)$/i,
        type: 'asset/resource',
},
```

## Loading Data

- csv xml

```js
npm install --save-dev csv-loader xml-loader

{
        test: /\.(csv|tsv)$/i,
        use: ['csv-loader'],
      },
      {
        test: /\.xml$/i,
        use: ['xml-loader'],
      },
```

Customize parser of JSON modules

- toml yml json

`npm install toml yamljs json5 --save-dev`

```js
const path = require("path");
const toml = require("toml");
const yaml = require("yamljs");
const json5 = require("json5");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
      {
        test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
        type: "asset/resource",
      },
      {
        test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf)$/i,
        type: "asset/resource",
      },
      {
        test: /\.(csv|tsv)$/i,
        use: ["csv-loader"],
      },
      {
        test: /\.xml$/i,
        use: ["xml-loader"],
      },
      {
        test: /\.toml$/i,
        type: "json",
        parser: {
          parse: toml.parse,
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.yaml$/i,
        type: "json",
        parser: {
          parse: yaml.parse,
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.json5$/i,
        type: "json",
        parser: {
          parse: json5.parse,
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
